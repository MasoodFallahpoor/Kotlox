Kotlox (WIP)
=======

Kotlox is an interpreter for the [Lox programming language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html),
written in Kotlin/JVM.

It's not a mere "IntelliJ IDEA -> menu -> code -> Convert Java File to Kotlin File" conversion of the reference
Java [implementation](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/java/com/craftinginterpreters/lox)!
Each line of Kotlox is handcrafted. That's the reason why Kotlox does not exactly match the reference Java
implementation. I've added some new classes, renamed some others, renamed some variables, etc.

I've written lots of unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation. They're all
